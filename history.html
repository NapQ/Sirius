            The history of Sirius SC club started many years ago, in 2016 to be precise. At the time, the club's founders, João Lucas and Napoleão Quezado knew each other, due to an exchange of schedules, which made the two study together for 3 years. During these 3 years, they became friends thanks to their common interests, mainly football. After this phase of their lives, they ended up following different paths, but decided to keep in touch. In the new phase of his life, João Lucas made friendships that, in the future, would help create Sirius SC, such as Th, Julio, Rafael, JP. With their lives changing, the friendship between Napoleão and João Lucas also changed, they got closer and decided to create a company Gash Productions, focused on design and audiovisual production, however, due to a busy life, this project had to be stopped. The desire of the two for football never faded, with that, they got together to create a new club, different from what everyone had seen, better. With that idea in mind, Sirius emerged, not just a team, but a star. With that, they transformed Gash, now not only being a production company, but a programming company, thus creating the Sirius website.
